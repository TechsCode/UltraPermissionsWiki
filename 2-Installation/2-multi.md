## Network Installation

Before installing, make sure bungeecord is set to true in EVERY spigot.yml

<br />

Firstly install the *UltraPermissions.jar* on every Server including your BungeeCord.
In the next step, you have to enable MySQL for every Server via the intuitive interface.

<br />

* Execute **/upc addSuperadmin (Your IGN)** via Console to give yourself the ability to access /uperms
* Execute **/uperms**, navigate to *Settings > MySQL* and enter your MySQL credentials
* Restart your Server

After you have repeated that process for every Server, Ultra Permissions should now be fully functional!

<br />

In the event that you create a new Server, just repeat the steps. The BungeeCord is configuring itself fully automatically
